## Chronology {.side-image}

![picture of chess pieces](assets/strategy.jpg)

- time: a line that goes "forward"
- entries are organized by day
- further organized by hour and minute
- (seconds are not really regarded)
- gthnk uses this chronology to organize your notes

## Handwritten Notes {.side-image}

![picture of chess pieces](assets/strategy.jpg)

- not all notes are suited to text files
- visual: drawings, schematics, diagrams, charts, graphs
- spontaneous: meetings, lectures, live events
- flexible: collaborative, multi-colors, outdoors
- Gthnk's solution: attach to Chronology
- learn the standardized handwritten page heading
- scan pages as PDF, drag-drop onto Gthnk

## Mobile Notes {.side-image}

![picture of chess pieces](assets/strategy.jpg)

- mobile is so convenient; always with you
- is the cloud secure? are your notes private?
- Gthnk is an offline database that runs on your computer
- Supports mobile text files via cloud drives
    - dropbox
    - google drive
    - etc...
- Gthnk's cloud compromise: global write, local read

## Attachments {.side-image}

![picture of chess pieces](assets/strategy.jpg)

- Attach digital media to a Day in Gthnk
    + PDFs, including handwritten notes
    + images: JPEGs, GIFs, PNGs, etc.
- drag-drop media onto drop target

## Scholarship in 2075 {.side-image}

![picture of chess pieces](assets/strategy.jpg)

- visualize a library in a not-so-distant future
- you are the academic of the future
- who were the people living in 2017?
- imagine the following grim scenario
- what if 98% of the data created between 1990 and 2030 is gone?
    + data death
        * irregular funding
        * accidents
        * Library of Alexandria events?
    + bit rot and entropy
    + link rot and disorganization
- what if 98% of the websites you see today didn't exist in 2075?
- what kind of culture are we creating?

## Percy Shelley's Ozymandias {.side-image}

![picture of chess pieces](assets/strategy.jpg)

- I met a traveller from an antique land
- Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
- Stand in the desert
- ...
- And on the pedestal these words appear:
- 'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
- Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
- Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
- Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
- The lone and level sands stretch far away.
