# Introduction to Gthnk

## Journal {.side-image}

![picture of chess pieces](assets/strategy.jpg)

- Logbook
- Lab Notebook
- Work Journal
- Quote book
- Daily Diary
- others?

## Chronology {.side-image}

![picture of chess pieces](assets/strategy.jpg)

- time: a line that goes "forward"
- entries are organized by day
- gthnk uses this chronology to organize your notes
    - further organized by hour and minute
    - (seconds are not really regarded)

## What *is* Gthnk? {.side-image}

![picture of chess pieces](assets/strategy.jpg)

- Gthnk is a database
- always running on your computer
- type your notes into a text file ("journal")
- supports markdown, so links and formatting work
- notes imported into database at midnight
- web browser to search and view notes
- use whatever editor and browser you want

- Emacs Org-mode
- Yojimbo
- DevonThink
- Google/Apple Notes

## Archival {.side-image}

![picture of chess pieces](assets/strategy.jpg)

- how much has Word .doc changed in 20 years?
- is there a future in digital formats?
- Gthnk's simple text file format can be printed
- printed hardcopy can be scanned and OCRed
- scanned result recreates original Gthnk database
- imagine a 100-year record with archival ink and paper

## Handwritten Notes {.side-image}

![picture of chess pieces](assets/strategy.jpg)

- not all notes are suited to text files
- visual: drawings, schematics, diagrams, charts, graphs
- spontaneous: meetings, lectures, live events
- flexible: collaborative, multi-colors, outdoors
- Gthnk's solution: attach to Chronology
- learn the standardized handwritten page heading
- scan pages as PDF, drag-drop onto Gthnk

## Mobile Notes {.side-image}

![picture of chess pieces](assets/strategy.jpg)

- mobile is so convenient; always with you
- is the cloud secure? are your notes private?
- Gthnk is an offline database that runs on your computer
- Supports mobile text files via cloud drives
    - dropbox
    - google drive
    - etc...
- Gthnk's cloud compromise: global write, local read

## Attachments {.side-image}

![picture of chess pieces](assets/strategy.jpg)

- Attach digital media to a Day in Gthnk
    + PDFs, including handwritten notes
    + images: JPEGs, GIFs, PNGs, etc.
- drag-drop media onto drop target

## Journal Rotation {.side-image}

    + **this is how stuff "gets into Gthnk"**.
- The UI has a "refresh" button that can also trigger rotation.
- Your journal files are cleared out at the end of rotation.
    + you start a new day with the blank file.
    + NB: You need a text editor that "notices" this

## Scholarship in 2075 {.side-image}

![picture of chess pieces](assets/strategy.jpg)

- visualize a library in a not-so-distant future
- you are the academic of the future
- who were the people living in 2017?
- imagine the following grim scenario
- what if 98% of the data created between 1990 and 2030 is gone?
    + data death
        * irregular funding
        * accidents
        * Library of Alexandria event?
    + bit rot and entropy
    + link rot and disorganization
- what if 98% of the websites you see today didn't exist in 2075?
- will your Word97 macros still work!?

## Percy Shelley's Ozymandias {.side-image}

![picture of chess pieces](assets/strategy.jpg)

- I met a traveller from an antique land
- Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
- Stand in the desert
- ...
- And on the pedestal these words appear:
- 'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
- Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
- Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
- Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
- The lone and level sands stretch far away.

## Who are we? {.side-image}

![picture of chess pieces](assets/strategy.jpg)

- What kind of culture are we creating?
- Is our culture lasting?
- Which parts will rot away and which parts will stay?
- we can already see our culture disappearing
    + Does anybody remember Geocities?
    + Did anybody spend time on their Myspace profile?
    + the BBC lost years-worth of early Dr. Who
- How can we be active participants in our own history?

## Nachlass {.side-image}

![picture of chess pieces](assets/strategy.jpg)

- from wikipedia:
    + from German, used in academia
    + nach: after
    + lassen: to leave
- papers left behind when a scholar dies
    + manuscripts
    + notes
    + correspondence
- it requires a great deal of effort to process a scholar's *Nachlass*
- effort = resources = money
    + which makes this unlikely
- **unless you do it yourself**
    + but don't forget Ozymandias
