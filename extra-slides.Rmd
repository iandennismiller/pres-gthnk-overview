# Philosophical Interlude

## Scholarship in 2075 {.side-image}

![picture of chess pieces](assets/strategy.jpg)

- visualize a library in a not-so-distant future
- you are the academic of the future
- who were the people living in 2017?
    + we are living in the Digital Dark Age
- imagine the following grim scenario
- what if 98% of the data created between 1990 and 2030 is gone?
    + data death
        * irregular funding
        * accidents
        * Library of Alexandria event?
    + bit rot and entropy
    + link rot and disorganization
- what if 98% of the websites you see today didn't exist in 2075?
- will your Word97 macros still work!?

## Percy Shelley's Ozymandias {.side-image}

![picture of chess pieces](assets/strategy.jpg)

- I met a traveller from an antique land
- Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
- Stand in the desert
- ...
- And on the pedestal these words appear:
- 'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
- Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
- Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
- Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
- The lone and level sands stretch far away.

## Who *are* we? {.side-image}

![picture of chess pieces](assets/strategy.jpg)

- What kind of culture are we creating?
- Is our culture lasting?
- Which parts will rot away and which parts will stay?
- we can already see our culture disappearing
    + Does anybody remember Geocities?
    + Did anybody spend time on their Myspace profile?
    + the BBC lost years-worth of early Dr. Who
- How can we be active participants in our own history?

## Nachlass {.side-image}

![picture of chess pieces](assets/strategy.jpg)

- from wikipedia:
    + from German, used in academia
    + nach: after
    + lassen: to leave
- papers left behind when a scholar dies
    + manuscripts
    + notes
    + correspondence
- it requires a great deal of effort to process a scholar's *Nachlass*
- effort = resources = money
    + which makes this unlikely
- **unless you do it yourself**
    + but don't forget Ozymandias
